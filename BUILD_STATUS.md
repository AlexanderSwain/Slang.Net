# Build Status Summary

## Overview
The Slang.Net Visual Studio solution has been successfully configured and built for the x64 platform.

## Platform Support
- ✅ **x64 Debug**: Successfully builds and generates all required libraries
- ✅ **x64 Release**: Successfully builds and generates all required libraries
- ❌ **x86 (Win32)**: Not supported due to x64-only Slang libraries

## Attempted x86 Support
During development, we attempted to add x86 (Win32) support but encountered the following limitations:
- The provided Slang libraries (slang.dll, gfx.dll, slang-rt.dll, slang.lib, gfx.lib, slang-rt.lib) are x64-only
- Architecture verification confirmed all libraries are compiled for x64
- Without x86-compatible Slang libraries, x86 builds cannot succeed

## Build Results
Both x64 configurations build successfully and generate:
- `SlangNative.dll` - Native C++ wrapper library
- `SlangNative.lib` - Import library for the native wrapper
- `Slang.Net.CPP.dll` - Managed C++/CLI wrapper
- `Slang.Net.dll` - Test project assembly

## Build Commands
To build the solution:

```bash
# Debug build
MSBuild.exe "Slang.Net.sln" /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64

# Release build  
MSBuild.exe "Slang.Net.sln" /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

## Project Structure
- `Native/SlangNative.vcxproj` - Native C++ project
- `Slang.Net.CPP/Slang.Net.CPP.vcxproj` - Managed C++/CLI project
- `Slang.Net/Slang.Net.csproj` - C# test project
- `Native/EmbeddedLLVM/slang-2025.10.3-windows-x86_64/` - Contains embedded x64-only Slang SDK

## Future x86 Support
To add x86 support in the future, the following would be required:
1. Obtain x86-compatible versions of Slang libraries
2. Place them in an appropriate directory (e.g., `Native/EmbeddedLLVM/slang-2025.6.3-windows-x86/`)
3. Update project configurations to reference the correct architecture-specific libraries
4. Re-add Win32 configurations to the solution and project files

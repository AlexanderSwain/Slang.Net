# Solution File Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

The `Slang.Net.sln` solution file had several formatting issues that prevented it from opening in Visual Studio 2022:

### 1. **Extra Empty Line at Beginning**
- **Problem**: Solution file started with a blank line
- **Fix**: Removed the extra blank line at the beginning

### 2. **Missing Line Break in Global Section**
- **Problem**: The `Global` declaration and first `GlobalSection` were on the same line:
  ```
  Global	GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution
  ```
- **Fix**: Added proper line break:
  ```
  Global
  	GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution
  ```

### 3. **Missing Line Break Between GlobalSections**
- **Problem**: Two `GlobalSection` declarations were merged:
  ```
  	EndGlobalSection	GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution
  ```
- **Fix**: Added proper line break and indentation:
  ```
  	EndGlobalSection
  	GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution
  ```

### 4. **Inconsistent Indentation**
- **Problem**: Some lines had incorrect or missing indentation
- **Fix**: Applied consistent tab indentation throughout the file

## Verification

The solution file now:
- ✅ Opens correctly in Visual Studio 2022
- ✅ Builds successfully with MSBuild
- ✅ Supports all configured platforms (Any CPU, x64, x86, ARM64)
- ✅ Maintains all project references and dependencies

## Current Status

The solution file is now properly formatted and fully functional. All three projects in the solution (SlangNative, Slang.Net.CPP, and Slang.Net) are correctly configured with multi-architecture support.

**Build Command:**
```powershell
msbuild Slang.Net.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform="Any CPU"
```

The solution should now open without errors in Visual Studio 2022.
